  "prompt": "Generate a full-body, front-view portrait of character protagonist based on the following description, with a pure white background. The character should be centered in the image, occupying most of the frame. Gazing straight ahead. Standing with arms relaxed at sides. Natural expression.\nFeatures: A full-body portrait of a young Victorian gentleman standing centered on a pure white background, in the style of Impressionist oil painting with rich chiaroscuro and visible brushstrokes. He is an exceptionally handsome man in his mid-twenties, with a slender, elegant build. His face is a masterpiece of refined beauty: an oval face with a flawless, pale complexion, high and delicate cheekbones, and a finely sculpted jawline. His eyes are large, expressive, and a striking shade of crystalline blue-grey, framed by long, dark lashes and slightly arched, defined eyebrows. His nose is straight and narrow, his lips are full, well-shaped, and naturally rosy, often set in a thoughtful, subtly melancholic expression that suggests deep sensitivity. His hair is a rich, dark chestnut brown, worn slightly longer than the period's strict fashion, with soft waves that fall just above his collar and a gentle, artful disarray that catches the light. He is dressed in the height of late 19th-century London elegance: a tailored, charcoal-grey frock coat of fine wool over a silver-grey silk waistcoat. Beneath is a crisp, white linen shirt with a high collar and a dark blue cravat tied in a precise Ascot knot. His trousers are matching charcoal-grey, tapering to polished black leather ankle boots. His posture is graceful yet relaxed, one hand perhaps resting lightly on a simple walking cane of polished dark wood, the other held loosely at his side. His overall aura is one of quiet contemplation and aesthetic refinement, his gaze seeming to perceive the subtle distortions in beauty that others miss. The lighting is soft and dramatic, mimicking gaslight, with warm highlights and cool shadows playing across his form, emphasizing the texture of the fabrics and the smoothness of his skin. No text, no symbols, no garbled characters, no words., full body, standing pose, arms relaxed at sides, pure white background, character centered, no text, no symbols, no garbled characters, no words\nStyle: oil_painting\nNo text, no symbols, no watermark, no garbled characters, no words.",
